# Working Hours in the Democratic Economic Planning

This project measures the human time required to deliver decent living standards through democratic economic planning. It reports weekly hours per 1,000 residents across core sectors (food, housing, utilities, care, mobility, industrial staples, culture, governance) under low/medium/high automation, then aggregates to total hours suggesting a ~10-hour social workweek at fixed quality and ecological ceilings

## What’s inside
- Clear service floors and ecological limits per sector.
- Transparent coefficients and formulas; direct + indirect hours.
- Scenario bands (low/medium/high) and conservative choices.
- Synthesis chapter with city/national roll-ups.

## Method in one line
Set floors → trace interdependencies → enforce safety/reliability → minimize necessary labor → sum to a social workweek.
